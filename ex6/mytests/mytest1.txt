Hello All:


Please see the attached flyer describing the graduate "Nonlinear Dynamics in Biological Systems" course I will be teaching this fall.

This is a course I taught multiple times at U. Texas and was quite popular.  It is now being offered first time here at Penn State.

Please feel free to pass along to any faculty or graduate students you know who might be interested.

I have also posted this to our new PSU Biomechanics "Slack" Page:  https://psubiomechanics.slack.com/

Please feel free to email me if you have questions.

Thank you!
Jon
